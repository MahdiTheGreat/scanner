# scanner
In this project we design a tool for collecting information and scanning some found information,
the second part includes the use of ready-made tools and getting to know how they work. 
It should be noted that the systems found in the IP range were previously examined 
to collect information and the results of the students' activities will be matched with them.
To test your device, you can use the IP range from 89.43.0.0 to 89.43.7.255.
Preferably, save the output of the items mentioned in paragraph 2 in a file named result_[ActionName].txt.
For example, the Python code file related to the ping part of the exercise should be named ping.py and its output
should be in the format result_ping.txt.
The ping part should work with both IP and domain name and its output is as follows:
The output of scanning the IP range and finding active hosts:
Output of open ports scan of active hosts:
